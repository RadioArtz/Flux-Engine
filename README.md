### FLUX ENGINE

**Flux Engine** is a **basic, x64 game engine / framework** built with **C# .NET 6**. It's a personal project for learning C# and exploring how game engines work.  
Note that Code Quality may not always be high as I experiment, temporarily hack things in and simply learn more about C#!

The engine is inspired by **Unity** and **Unreal Engine** and is designed for creating basic **2D and 3D games** or tools.

## üöÄ Features  

- **Rendering**: Uses **OpenGL Core 4.1** (via OpenTK).  
- **Audio**: Supports **2D and 3D audio** using the **Bass library**.  
- **Model Loading**: Handled through **AssimpNet**.  
- **Texture Loading**: Managed with **StbImageSharp**.  
- **Cross-Platform Goals**: Primarily Windows, with Linux support in mind.

## üéÆ Getting Started  

### Requirements  

1. **Visual Studio 2022**  
2. **.NET 6 SDK**  
3. [Bass library](https://www.un4seen.com/files/bass24.zip) & [.NET wrapper](https://www.un4seen.com/files/z/4/Bass24.Net.zip).  
4. NuGet dependencies (auto-managed).

### üìÇ Setting Up Your Project  

1. Clone this repository and open the solution in Visual Studio.  
2. Add a **new project** to the solution.  
3. Add a reference to the `FluxEngine` project.  

### üîß Basic Setup  

#### `Program.cs`  
```csharp
using Flux;
using Flux.Types;

namespace FluxGame
{
    public static class Game
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Engine.Main(args, () => GameStart());
        }

        public static void GameStart()
        {
            Engine.window!.SetActiveScene(new ExampleScene());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Creating a Scene  
```csharp
using Flux.Types;

namespace FluxGame
{
    public class ExampleScene : FScene
    {
        public override void OnLoad()
        {
            base.OnLoad();
            // Set up your scene here
        }

        public override void OnTick(float delta)
        {
            base.OnTick(delta);
            // Game logic goes here
        }
    }
}
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Sample Usage  
Check out the [FluxGame folder](https://github.com/RadioArtz/Flux-Engine/tree/main/FluxGame) for examples like:  
- **An osu! Mania map parser.**  
- **A primitive voxel terrain generator.**
